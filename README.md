# Description 
This repository is a dedicated workspace designed to master FastAPI through a "Learning by Doing" approach. The primary goal is to perform a deep dive into the official documentation while building practical projects and documenting key concepts to consolidate technical knowledge.

As part of my professional growth, this project also serves as an immersive exercise to strengthen my technical English skills, ensuring that all documentation, code comments, and commit messages are written in English.

### 🎯 Main Objectives
Documentation Mastery: A step-by-step study of FastAPI core features, from basic routing to advanced dependency injection.

Practical Implementation: Building real-world scenarios (such as an ATM system simulation) to implement concurrency, Pydantic models, and security best practices.

Knowledge Base: Creating a persistent set of notes, code snippets, and explanations for future reference and to assist other developers.

Language Proficiency: Improving English fluency and vocabulary within a software development and backend engineering context.

### 🛠 Tech Stack
Framework: FastAPI (Python)
Data Validation: Pydantic
Web Server: Uvicorn
Environment Management: Python Venv & Dotenv (Pydantic Settings)
